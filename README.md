#### Description:
Hey everyone! Welcome to the project which I have been working on called Musify. It's a website I created to help people discover new music based on their preferences. Musify aims to simplify that process by providing personalized recommendations tailored to each user's unique tastes. It will not play songs directly but provide carefully curated recommendations based on your preferences which you will probably love. Let me break it down for you.

● The purpose

So, the whole idea behind Musify is to make it easier for people to find music that matches their tastes. I know it can be overwhelming to sift through endless playlists and albums, so I wanted to create something that simplifies that process. Whether you're into the latest hits, some obscure indie tracks, or classic tunes, Musify aims to have something for everyone.

● Features

Musify offers a variety of features to enhance your music discovery experience:

1. User Preferences: When you use Musify, you tell it what kind of music you like. You can specify your favorite genres, artists, etc. This helps the system understand what you're into.

2. Personalized Recommendations: Based on what you tell it, Musify uses some pretty smart algorithms and a bit of curation to suggest songs that match your taste. The recommendations are customized to ensure they are relevant and enjoyable for you.

3. Diverse Selection: The platform has a wide range of music from different genres, languages and eras. This means there's always something new to discover, no matter what kind of music you're into.

● Tools and Tech

To bring Musify to life, I used several technologies:

1. Python: This was the backbone of the project. I used it for most of the backend logic and for server-side validation.

2. Flask: This is the web framework that I used with Python, which I used to set up the web server and handle routing.

3. CSS (Tailwind): For styling the website, I used Tailwind CSS.

4. SQLite3: This is the database where I store all the song information.

5. JavaScript: Just a bit of JavaScript to handle some of the interactive elements on the site.

● Why I made it

I made Musify because I am passionate about music and I wanted to create a tool that helps people discover and enjoy music more easily. Plus, working on this project gave me a chance to hone my skills with Python, Flask, Tailwind CSS, SQLite3 and a little bit of JavaScript.

● How It Works

1. Get Started
    ● Click on Get Started or users can click on Search button in navigation bar as desired.

2. Set Preferences
    ● Users can set preferences by selecting their favourite genres, artists and much more! But the users must remember that they have to set least 4 preferences in order to get the recomendations of songs. Well, it's obvious that the more preference you set, the more precise recomendations of songs the users will get.

3. Get recomendations
    ● Based on the preferences set, Musify provides a list of song recomendations. These recommendations are tailored to match the user's taste, ensuring they find music they'll love.

4. Explore and connect
    ● Users can also contact with the developer. They can send messages pertaining to the website if any kind of query arises.

● Server-side validation

Musify also includes server-side validation to ensure the data submitted by users is valid. This means that even if someone tries to bypass client-side validation, the server will still check and ensure all input data meets the necessary criteria. For example:

    ● To check if the the choice filling is valid.
    ● To check if the users correctly enter data.
    ● To check if the users enter at least four preferences to get the recomendation of songs.

● More on the website

I have created an info tab in case the users do not have any about the terms used in search tab. I give given a short and crisp information regarding the terms so that the users can quickly understand them and can apply them as desired.

In the contacts tab, although users can directly send a query from there pertaining to the website but the users can alternativily send emails to the developer by themselves from elsewhere as I have provided the email address, contact number and also my work address.

In the about tab, I have briefly described my website and its main motto.

● Conclusion

Musify is a project I'm passionate about because I believe in the power of music to bring joy and create connections. This platform is designed to make discovering new music easy and fun, tailored to each user's preferences. Whether you're looking for the latest hits, hidden gems, or classic tunes, Musify has something for everyone.

Please do check out the video that I have made as a demo to this website.

Thank you for checking out Musify! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
